## 🔍 Data Preprocessing Workflow

This section of the repository demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques used in data analysis and machine learning pipelines. The following key steps are covered:

1. **📥 Data Reading**  
   Load datasets from various formats such as CSV, Excel, and JSON using Pandas.

2. **📊 Data Description**  
   Generate descriptive statistics to understand data distribution, types, and summary metrics.

3. **✂️ Data Splitting**  
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` for model evaluation.

4. **🚨 Outlier Identification**  
   Detect and visualize outliers using statistical methods such as IQR and Z-score.

5. **❓ Missing Values Detection**  
   Identify null or missing values and explore their impact on the dataset.

6. **🧹 Handling Missing Values**  
   Apply techniques such as imputation (mean/median/mode) or row/column removal to handle missing data effectively.

These preprocessing steps ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or modeling.
